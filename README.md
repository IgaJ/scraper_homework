# Scraping homework

Your goal is to write code that will scrape RSS content feed from an external publisher that is available under this url address: https://connect.thairath.co.th/ws/kaikai/content/trplus. The resulsts of the scraping should be converted to PublisherContent class and stored in the database.

Make sure that subsequent scraping runs will not be duplicated. It is not needed to update existing PublisherContents that were stored previously, if the content already exists it can be ignored.

Make sure to remove links to other articles from the content if there are any.

Fork this repository and provide us with the link to your fork after you're done.

Good luck!
